dymax.py is a simple geodetic conversion tool for conversion from Lat/Lon to Dymaxion Fuller Projection

Dymaxion Projection Module (aka Fuller Projection)

The various intersecting great circle patterns on the spherical surface result
in the creation of many spherical triangles. Such a spherical triangle
(with its mirror image triangle) Fuller called an LCD (Lowest Common
Dinominator) triangle. A diffferent LCD spherical triangle is generated when
the Icosahedron is used as the polyhedron to be spun.
