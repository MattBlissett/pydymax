# Dymaxion Projection Module (aka Fuller Projection)
This is a simple geodetic conversion tool for conversion from Lat/Lon to Dymaxion Fuller Map Projection Coordinates

The various intersecting great circle patterns on the spherical surface result
in the creation of many spherical triangles. Such a spherical triangle
(with its mirror image triangle) Fuller called an LCD (Lowest Common
Denominator) triangle. A different LCD spherical triangle is generated when
the Icosahedron is used as the polyhedron to be spun.
