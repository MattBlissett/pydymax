# Dymaxion Projection Module
This is a simple geodetic conversion tool for conversion from Lat/Lon to Dymaxion Fuller Map Projection Coordinates

The conversion routine is as follows. The specified (lon,lat) pair is first converted to spherical coordinates, then cartesian. That value is then used to determine the face number (0-19) and sub-triangle (0-5) of the icosahedron. All this information is then fed into a final subroutine that outputs an (X,Y) position pair suitable for mapping. Results from conversion are cached so repeated calls query a lookup-table first. Note that this is not WGS84 accurate.

Technically, to unfold the earth into an icosahedron, we must first consider slicing the surface using various intersecting great circle patterns. This results in 20 spherical triangles. Such spherical triangles Buckminster Fuller called LCD (Lowest Common Dinominator) triangles.
